This repository presents a simplified version of the famous game Blackjack programmed in Python using Object Oriented Programming.

## A project full of learnings : structure, testing, refactoring

I programmed it 100% alone as a learning project. I used it as a ways to program in a clean way :

- Repository structure : I structured the project in different files with each there own elements (before I had only programmed in 1 file)
- Testing : during the process I learned to use the testing library Unittest
- Refactoring : I blocked at one point, which forced me to search help and advices of more experienced programmers. I could then do the refactoring of my codes\*

Note : The version before refactoring is in the archives of this repository

## Udemy project but programmed without the roadmap

This project is part of the Udemy class "The Complete Python Bootcamp From Zero to Hero in Python". However in contrast to the other milestone projects of the class, I did NOT use the roadmap of the class in this project.

## Why simplified version?

The player can only hit or stands. Other actions have been removed.

## Rules of the Blackjack

Here are the rules of the game :
The object is to have a hand with a total value higher than the dealer's without going over 21.
Kings, Queens, Jacks and Tens are worth a value of 10.
An Ace has the value of 1 or 11. The remaining cards are counted at face value.
