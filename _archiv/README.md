This part of the repository is composed of the original version of my code. It contains the test file with my learnings of the Unittest library.

I faced problems with dealing with the aces' value, which led me to overcomplicate the code. Because of that I could not go further way.

Therefore I refactored the code in a cleaner structure, and simplified (I used the solution of the course, to set the value of the ace as 11 and remove 10 when it bursted).
